for multiple lights instead of just one. This is the final article on lighting
– at least for a while.

Directional Lights
------------------

<figure class="nopadding">
  <img src="/images/posts/modern-opengl-08/directional-light.jpg" />
</figure>

Directional lights are lights that shine in a single, uniform direction. That
is, all rays of light are parallel to each other. Pure directional lights do
not exist (except maybe lasers?) but they are often used in computer graphics
to imitate strong light sources that are very far away, such as the Sun. The
Sun radiates light in all directions, like a point light. Over an enormous
distance, however, the tiny fraction of light rays that make it to earth appear
to be almost parallel.

<blockquote class="pull-right">
  Directional lights are implemented such that they ignore attenuation.
</blockquote>

As we saw in the [previous article on homogeneous
coordinates][homo_coords_article], directional lights can be thought of as
point lights that are infinitely far away. This causes an unfortunate
interaction with attenuation. Attenuation is the reduction of light intensity
over distance – the greater the distance, the dimmer the light is. If there is
even the tiniest amount of attenuation, over an infinite distance the light
becomes infinitely dim (i.e. invisible). For this reason, directional lights
are implemented such that they ignore attenuation. This kind-of makes sense if
we're using directional lights to represent the Sun, because the sunlight we
see here on Earth doesn't appear to be attenuated. That is, sunlight doesn't
appear to get dimmer as it gets closer to the ground.

<blockquote class="pull-right">
  We can represent the direction of a directional light with a homogeneous
  coordinate by setting $$W = 0$$.
</blockquote>

Unlike point lights, directional lights do not need a position coordinate. A
directional light only needs a single 3D vector that represents the direction
of all the rays of light.  However, the GLSL lighting code in our shader
expects every light to have a position. Luckily, we can represent the direction
of a directional light with a homogeneous coordinate by setting $$W = 0$$.  As
explained in the [previous article on homogeneous
coordinates][homo_coords_article], when $$W = 0$$ in a 4D coordinate, it
represents the direction of a point that is infinitely far away.  So if the
coordinate represents the direction _towards_ the Sun, we can just negate it to
produce the direction _away_ from the Sun, which is the direction of the light
rays. Using this method of representing directional lights inside the position
vector, we could have code that looks like this:

```glsl
uniform vec4 lightPosition;

// check if this is a directional light
if(lightPosition.w == 0.0) {
  // it is a directional light.
  // get the direction by converting to vec3 (ignore W) and negate it
  vec3 lightDirection = -lightPosition.xyz
} else {
  // NOT a directional light
}
```

As an example, let's say that `lightPosition` coordinate is $$(1, 0, 0, 0)$$,
which represents a point infinitely far away down the _positive_ X axis.  If we
take the $$X$$, $$Y$$, and $$Z$$ values then negate them, we get $$(-1, 0,
0)$$, which indicates that the light is shining down the _negative_ X axis.

The GLSL lighting code we implemented in the previous article uses the
direction from the surface to the light (in a variable named `surfaceToLight`),
so we don't actually need to negate anything. The GLSL for directional lights
in this article looks like this:

```glsl
vec3 ApplyLight(Light light, vec3 surfaceColor, vec3 normal, vec3 surfacePos, vec3 surfaceToCamera) {
    vec3 surfaceToLight;
    float attenuation = 1.0;
    if(light.position.w == 0.0) {
        //directional light
        surfaceToLight = normalize(light.position.xyz);
        attenuation = 1.0; //no attenuation for directional lights
    } else {
        // NOT directional light
        //... (code ommited)
    }

    // the rest of the lighting calculation
    //... (code ommited)
}
```

Spotlights
----------

<figure class="nopadding">
  <img src="/images/posts/modern-opengl-08/spotlight.jpg" />
</figure>

The final type of light we will be implementing is spotlights. Spotlights are
very similar to point lights, except that instead of radiating light out in all
directions, the light rays are restricted to a cone shape. The light rays are
_not_ parallel like directional lights, but they do shine out in a general
direction. Think of a flashlight. There is a light bulb in there that acts like
a point light, but there is also a reflective curved surface that restricts
where the light can shine.

<blockquote class="pull-right">
  We will model spotlights as point lights with a cone restriction.
</blockquote>

We will model spotlights as point lights with a cone restriction. Everything
that applies to point lights also applies to spotlights, except for two
extra variables: the direction of the cone, and the angle of the cone. Here
is the definition of the `Light` struct for this article:

```glsl
uniform struct Light {
   vec4 position;
   vec3 intensities;
   float attenuation;
   float ambientCoefficient;
   float coneAngle;    // new
   vec3 coneDirection; // new
};
```

There are two new variables that were added in order to implement spotlights:
`coneAngle` and `coneDirection`. The `coneDirection` variable is the direction
from the point of the cone, through the center of the cone. The `coneAngle`
variable is the angle between the center and the side of the cone, in degrees.

<figure class="black nopadding">
  <img src="/images/posts/modern-opengl-08/cone-direction-angle.jpg" />
</figure>

<blockquote class="pull-right">
  If the ray is outside of the cone, then we set the attenuation
  factor to zero.
</blockquote>
  
The implementation is fairly simple. For every light ray we calculate, we check
whether it is inside or outside of the cone. If it's inside, we continue with
the lighting calculations as we normally would. If the ray is _outside_ of the
cone, then we set the attenuation factor to zero, which will make the
light ray invisible. Here is the GLSL that implements the cone restriction:


```glsl
float lightToSurfaceAngle = degrees(acos(dot(-surfaceToLight, normalize(light.coneDirection))));
if(lightToSurfaceAngle > light.coneAngle){
    attenuation = 0.0;
}
```

The first line is pretty dense, so let me explain it by break it down into
smaller steps:

```glsl
// 1. Get the direction for the center of the cone. The `normalize`
//    function is called just in case `light.coneDirection` isn't
//    already a unit vector.
vec3 coneDirection = normalize(light.coneDirection);

// 2. Get the direction of the ray of light. This is the opposite
//    of the direction from the surface to the light.
vec3 rayDirection = -surfaceToLight;

// 3. Get the angle between the center of the cone and the ray of light.
//    The combination of `acos` and `dot` return the angle in radians, then
//    we convert it to degrees.
float lightToSurfaceAngle = degrees(acos(dot(rayDirection, coneDirection)))

// 4. Check if the angle is outside of the cone. If so, set the attenuation
//    factor to zero, to make the light ray invisible.
if(lightToSurfaceAngle > light.coneAngle){
  attenuation = 0.0;
}
```

These cone restrictions are going to be applied to all non-directional lights, which
includes point lights. To stop the restrictions from applying to a point light,
all we have to do is set `coneAngle` to `180.0`, which means that light can
shine in all directions.


Multiple Lights
---------------

<blockquote class="pull-right">
  We are just refactoring the existing fragment shader code and adding a loop.
</blockquote>

The fragment shader for the previous article only implemented a single light so
let's replace the single light with an array of lights. Then we can loop over
them in the fragment shader, and apply them all to the scene. We aren't really
implementing anything new here. We are just refactoring the existing fragment
shader code and adding a loop.

The first step is to remove the single light uniform from the fragment shader,
and replace it with an array. This is the old GLSL from the previous article:

```glsl
// code from previous article (a single light)
uniform struct Light {
   vec3 position;
   vec3 intensities; //a.k.a the color of the light
   float attenuation;
   float ambientCoefficient;
} light;
```

And this is the new code, with an array of lights:

```glsl
// array of lights
#define MAX_LIGHTS 10
uniform int numLights;
uniform struct Light {
   vec4 position;
   vec3 intensities; //a.k.a the color of the light
   float attenuation;
   float ambientCoefficient;
   float coneAngle;
   vec3 coneDirection;
} allLights[MAX_LIGHTS];
```

This implementation is very similar to the lighting implementation in the old
fixed-function pipeline of OpenGL. There is a maximum number of lights, set
in the `MAX_LIGHTS` constant. Then there is an uniform variable that
hold the array of lights, called `allLights`. Lastly, there is a uniform
variable that holds the number of lights we are actually using, called
`numLights`.

The next step is to refactor the GLSL code so that it loops over the array.
We extract all the lighting code into a function called `ApplyLight`, which
does the entire lighting calculation for a single light. Here is the
GLSL for the `ApplyLight` function:

```glsl
vec3 ApplyLight(Light light, vec3 surfaceColor, vec3 normal, vec3 surfacePos, vec3 surfaceToCamera) {
    vec3 surfaceToLight;
    float attenuation = 1.0;
    if(light.position.w == 0.0) {
        //directional light
        surfaceToLight = normalize(light.position.xyz);
        attenuation = 1.0; //no attenuation for directional lights
    } else {
        //point light
        surfaceToLight = normalize(light.position.xyz - surfacePos);
        float distanceToLight = length(light.position.xyz - surfacePos);
        attenuation = 1.0 / (1.0 + light.attenuation * pow(distanceToLight, 2));

        //cone restrictions (affects attenuation)
        float lightToSurfaceAngle = degrees(acos(dot(-surfaceToLight, normalize(light.coneDirection))));
        if(lightToSurfaceAngle > light.coneAngle/2.0){
            attenuation = 0.0;
        }
    }

    //ambient
    vec3 ambient = light.ambientCoefficient * surfaceColor.rgb * light.intensities;

    //diffuse
    float diffuseCoefficient = max(0.0, dot(normal, surfaceToLight));
    vec3 diffuse = diffuseCoefficient * surfaceColor.rgb * light.intensities;
    
    //specular
    float specularCoefficient = 0.0;
    if(diffuseCoefficient > 0.0)
        specularCoefficient = pow(max(0.0, dot(surfaceToCamera, reflect(-surfaceToLight, normal))), materialShininess);
    vec3 specular = specularCoefficient * materialSpecularColor * light.intensities;

    //linear color (color before gamma correction)
    return ambient + attenuation*(diffuse + specular);
}
```

The `ApplyLight` function takes a single light as an argument, but it also
takes some arguments that describe the surface that is being lit:
`surfaceColor`, `normal`, `surfacePos`, and `surfaceToCamera`. Because all the
lights are acting upon the same surface, we calculate these surface-related
variables once, and pass them in as arguments for every light.

With all the lighting code extracted into a function, we can loop through
all the lights. For each light, we call `ApplyLight` and add all the
results together to get the color for the surface:

```glsl
vec3 linearColor = vec3(0);
for(int i = 0; i < numLights; ++i){
    linearColor += ApplyLight(allLights[i], surfaceColor.rgb, normal, surfacePos, surfaceToCamera);
}
```

C++ Code Changes
----------------

The changes to the C++ code are mainly just mirrors of the GLSL changes.

The `Light` struct changes slightly, to accommodate directional lights and
spotlights. The `position` element changes from a `glm::vec3` to a
`glm::vec4`, and we add the two spotlight cone variables `coneDirection`
and `coneAngle`.

```cpp
struct Light {
    glm::vec4 position;
    glm::vec3 intensities; //a.k.a. the color of the light
    float attenuation;
    float ambientCoefficient;
    float coneAngle; // new
    glm::vec3 coneDirection; // new
};
```

In the globals, we change the single light to a `std::vector` of lights:

```cpp
// Light gLight; // used to be this in previous article
std::vector<Light> gLights;
```

In the `RenderInstance` function, we now have to loop through all the
lights when we set the uniforms:

```cpp
shaders->setUniform("numLights", (int)gLights.size());

for(size_t i = 0; i < gLights.size(); ++i){
    SetLightUniform(shaders, "position", i, gLights[i].position);
    SetLightUniform(shaders, "intensities", i, gLights[i].intensities);
    SetLightUniform(shaders, "attenuation", i, gLights[i].attenuation);
    SetLightUniform(shaders, "ambientCoefficient", i, gLights[i].ambientCoefficient);
    SetLightUniform(shaders, "coneAngle", i, gLights[i].coneAngle);
    SetLightUniform(shaders, "coneDirection", i, gLights[i].coneDirection);
}
```

This uses a function called `SetLightUniform`, which constructs the uniform names
based on the struct element and the index (e.g. `"allLights[2].coneAngle"`).

```cpp
template <typename T>
void SetLightUniform(tdogl::Program* shaders, const char* propertyName, size_t lightIndex, const T& value) {
    std::ostringstream ss;
    ss << "allLights[" << lightIndex << "]." << propertyName;
    std::string uniformName = ss.str();

    shaders->setUniform(uniformName.c_str(), value);
}
```

In `AppMain`, we create a spotlight and a directional light:

```cpp
// setup lights
Light spotlight;
spotlight.position = glm::vec4(-4,0,10,1);
spotlight.intensities = glm::vec3(2,2,2); //strong white light
spotlight.attenuation = 0.1f;
spotlight.ambientCoefficient = 0.0f; //no ambient light
spotlight.coneAngle = 15.0f;
spotlight.coneDirection = glm::vec3(0,0,-1);

Light directionalLight;
directionalLight.position = glm::vec4(1, 0.8, 0.6, 0); //w == 0 indications a directional light
directionalLight.intensities = glm::vec3(0.4,0.3,0.1); //weak yellowish light
directionalLight.ambientCoefficient = 0.06;

gLights.push_back(spotlight);
gLights.push_back(directionalLight);
```

And in the `Update` function, we make the key <kbd>1</kbd> change the position and
direction of the spotlight:

```cpp
//move light
if(glfwGetKey('1')){
    gLights[0].position = glm::vec4(gCamera.position(), 1.0);
    gLights[0].coneDirection = gCamera.forward();
}
```

Further Lighting
----------------

At this point, we have basically implemented all the lighting options that were
available in the old fixed-function API of OpenGL. We went a step further by
implementing per-fragment lighting instead of per-vertex lighting, but there
are many more improvements that we haven't covered.  Lighting is a huge subject,
so for now I'm just going to give a brief overview of a few advanced lighting
topics.

### Blinn-Phong

Our lighting in this series is an implemention of the Phong reflection model.
There is a slightly better version of this algorithm, called the [Blinn-Phong][]
reflection model. Blinn-Phong is a bit more accurate, and has slightly
better performance too.

### Fancier Spotlights

The spotlight implementation in this article is very basic. It could be improved by
softening the hard edges in GLSL using the [mix function][]. You could also
sample a flashlight texture to stop the light from looking so flat.

### Deferred Rendering

<figure class="youtube">
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/vooznqE-XMM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</figure>

The way we have implemented lighting is known as forward rendering,
and there are a couple of annoying issues associated with it. Firstly, there
is a limit to the number of lights we can have. Secondly, every pixel that gets
drawn requires calculations for every light &ndash; even if there are lights
that do not affect the pixel &ndash; which can be a performance issue. Ideally,
we want to be able to have thousands of lights with decent performance. To
address these issues, we could use [deferred rendering][].

Deferred rendering is a technique where you split rendering up into multiple
passes. The first pass renders geometry without any lights. In subsequent
passes, the lights are rendered one at a time. Lighting happens to every
_pixel_, instead of every _fragment_, which improves performance. You are
also able to restrict which pixels each light affects to further improve
performance.

In summary, deferred rendering allows lots of lights with decent performance,
but it is more complicated than forward rendering.

### Shadows

<figure class="youtube">
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0EjvtQdTHB0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</figure>

Despite that fact that everyone loves the look of them, nice shadows are a huge
can of worms, and can be extremely complicated. All the following techniques
are way more complicated than what this series of articles has covered so far.

[Shadow maps][] are probably the simplest technique, but the resulting shadows
can be weird and pixelated.

[Shadow volumes][] give pixel-perfect results, but they require complicated
processing on your geometry, which is slow.

When the light and the geometry are both static, then [lightmaps][] are accurate
and have good performance.

Don't even get me started on [ambient occlusion][].

### High-dynamic-range (HDR)

<figure class="nopadding">
  <img class="captioned" src="/images/posts/modern-opengl-08/hdr.jpg" />
  <figcaption>

      Richard Huber
    </a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Notice how the colors from all the lights are added together in our fragment
shader. The RGBA values are supposed to be within the 0.0 to 1.0 range, so what
happens if there are lots of lights, and the sum ends up being greater than
1.0? The colors would get clamped, and look weird. Also, if the lights
are too dim, the whole scene could look basically black, with no detail.
High-dynamic-range (HDR) rendering can help to fix these problems.

The human eye adjusts depending on the brightness of what it's looking at. If
you are in a dark room for long enough, your pupils dilate to allow more light
to reach your retina, which makes the room seem brighter. If you walk outside
into bright sunlight, the opposite happens, so that you don't go blind from the
intense light. HDR rendering sort of imitates how your eye works, in order to
keep the details visible in very dark and very bright scenes.

### Subsurface Scattering

<figure class="black">
  <img src="/images/posts/modern-opengl-08/sss.png" />

      Piotrek Chwała
    </a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>


Light doesn't just reflect _off_ of surfaces, it can travel _through_ them too.
When light penetrates a surface, it changes the color of that surface. Rendering
this color change is called [subsurface scattering][].

Even though skin looks fairly opaque, subsurface scattering is generally used for
realistic rendering of human skin. Without it, skin tends to look like painted
plastic.

### Emissive Surfaces

<figure class="nopadding">
  <img class="captioned" src="/images/posts/modern-opengl-08/emissive.png" />
  <figcaption>Emissive surfaces from the game Borderlands</figcaption>
</figure>

In our implementation, only lights can illuminate a surface. Some surfaces, however,
provide their own illumination, which makes it look like they are glowing. Think of
a firefly, glow-in-the-dark stickers, or [those weird glowing mushrooms][].

Emissive lights are pretty easy to implement in OpenGL. Send an extra color uniform
to the shaders, along with the materials texture and shininess, and add that color
to the final color. Alternatively, you can send an extra texture instead of a
single color.

### Normal Mapping

<figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/modern-opengl-08/normal-map.png" />
  <figcaption>

    <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Normal_map_example.png">

    </a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

3D meshes have limits to the number of vertices they can contain, due to performance.
Making a surface rough or bumpy with geometry can take a lot of vertices, so
[normal maps][] are often used instead. Normal maps can be used to make an angular-looking
3D model look less angular, and more realistic.

A normal map is a texture that affects the surface normal. It is like the
surface texture that we have implemented, except it contains XYZ vectors
instead of RGB colors. The surface normal is an important part of the lighting
calculations, and it affects the brightness of each pixel.

Conclusion
----------

That wraps up our lighting implementation for now. After adding directional
lights and spotlights, we have recreated the functionality that was available
in the old fixed-function OpenGL API.

Welcome to the first of a series of articles about modern OpenGL.  All the code
will be open source, and downloadable from github:
https://github.com/tomdalling/opengl-series.

By the end of this article, you will have a working OpenGL 3.2 project in
Visual Studio 2013 on Windows, and Xcode on OSX. The app will have a vertex
shader, a fragment shader, and will display a single triangle using a VAO and a
VBO. The project will use [GLEW][] to access the OpenGL API, [GLFW][] to handle
window creation and input, and [GLM][] for matrix/vector math.

Yes, it is a little bit boring, but just getting a project set up correctly can
be difficult, especially for beginners. Once this is out of the way we will get
into the more interesting stuff.

<h2><a name="a_note_on_compatibility">A Note On Compatibility</a></h2>

These articles use OpenGL 3.2, but I will try to keep the code compatible with:

 -  OpenGL 2.1 for backwards compatibility
 -  OpenGL 3.X and 4.X for forwards compatibility
 -  OpenGL ES 2.0 for compatibility with Android and iOS

Because there are so many different versions of OpenGL and GLSL, the code won't
be 100% compatible with all the versions mentioned above. I hope for it to be
99% compatible, requiring only very minor changes when switching between
versions.

Too see the differences between the versions of OpenGL and GLSL, [good
compatibility tables are available here][].


<h2><a name="visual_cpp_setup">Visual Studio Setup</a></h2>

The code was created and tested on Windows 7 32bit, in [Visual Studio Express
2013][] (which is available for free). You should be able to just open the
solution and build all of the projects successfully, but if you can't then
please let me know, or send me a fix and I will update the project.


<h2><a name="xcode_setup">Xcode Setup</a></h2>

The Xcode project was created and tested on OSX 10.10, in Xcode 6.1. You should
be able to open the Xcode project and build all of the targets successfully,
without any additional setup steps. Please let me know if the Xcode project
does not build successfully for you.


<h2><a name="linux_setup">Linux Setup</a></h2>

The linux port of this article was kindly provided by [SpartanJ][]. I tested it
quickly on Ubuntu 12.04.

 -  Install GLM, GLFW, and GLEW with: `sudo aptitude install libglm-dev libglew-dev libglfw-dev`
 -  Change into the directory of the project with: `cd platforms/linux/01_project_skeleton`
 -  Run the makefile with: `make`
 -  Run the executable with: `bin/01_project_skeleton-debug`


<h2><a name="introducing_glew_glfw_glm">Introducing GLEW, GLFW, and GLM</a></h2>

Now that you have a working project, let's start by introducing the open-source
libraries that the project uses, and why they are necessary.

[The OpenGL Extension Wrangler (GLEW)][GLEW] is what we will be using to give
us access to the OpenGL 3.2 API functions. Unfortunately, accessing OpenGL
functions isn't as simple as `#include <GL/gl.h>` unless you want to use an
ancient version of OpenGL. In modern OpenGL, the API functions are determined
at *run time*, not *compile time*. GLEW will handle the run time loading of the
OpenGL API.

[GLFW][] will allow us to create a window, and receive mouse and keyboard input
in a cross-platform way. OpenGL does not handle window creation or input, so
this must be done somewhere else. I chose GLFW over the alternatives because it
is very small, and easy to understand.

[OpenGL Mathematics (GLM)][] is a mathematics library that handles vectors
and matrices, amongst other things. Older versions of OpenGL provided functions
like `glRotate`, `glTranslate`, and `glScale`, which would do some of the math
for you. In modern OpenGL, the previously mentioned functions do not exist, and
we must do all of the math ourselves. GLM will help a lot in future articles,
when we start digging into vector and matrix math.

During this series of articles, we will also be making our own small library of
reusable C++ code in the `tdogl` namespace. This article will include
`tdogl::Shader` and `tdogl::Program`, which are used to load, compile, and link
shaders.


<h2><a name="what_are_shaders">What Are Shaders?</a></h2>

Shaders are an important concept in modern OpenGL. The application will not run
without them, and the code won't make much sense unless you understand what
they are.

<blockquote class="pull-right">
  Shaders are little programs, made from GLSL code, that run on the
  <strong>GPU</strong> instead of the <em>CPU</em>.
</blockquote>

Shaders are little programs, made from GLSL code, that run on the **GPU**
instead of the *CPU*. They are written in [OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL)][],
which looks like C or C++, but it is a different language. The way you make a
shader is similar to the way you make a normal program: you write the code,
then you compile the code, then you link bits of compiled code together to make
the final program.

"Shaders" is not a very good name for them, because they do a lot more than
just shading. Just think of them as little programs, written in a different
language, that will run on your graphics card.

In older version of OpenGL, shaders were optional. In modern OpenGL, shaders
are *required* in order to get anything to show on the screen.

For a closer look at shaders and the graphics pipeline with nice pictures, I
recommend [The Graphics Pipeline chapter][] of the Durian Software series of
articles.

|                | Main Program           | Shader Program |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Language       | C++                    | GLSL           |
| Main function  | int main(int, char**); | void main();   |
| Runs on        | CPU                    | GPU            |
| Gets compiled? | yes                    | yes            |
| Gets linked?   | yes                    | yes            |

So what do shaders actually do? That depends on what *type* of shader they are.


<h3><a name="vertex_shaders">Vertex Shaders</a></h3>

<blockquote class="pull-right">
  The main purpose of a vertex shader is to transform points (x, y, and z
  coordinates) into different points.
</blockquote>

The main purpose of a vertex shader is to transform points (x, y, and z
coordinates) into different points. A vertex is a is just a point in a shape.
One point is called a "vertex", and multiple points are called "vertices"
(pronounced "[ver-tuh-seez][]").  In this article, we have a triangle made of
three vertices.

Here is the GLSL code for the vertex shader used in this article:

```glsl
#version 150

in vec3 vert;

void main() {
    // does not alter the vertices at all
    gl_Position = vec4(vert, 1);
}
```

The first line `#version 150` tells OpenGL that this shader is written in GLSL
version 1.50.

The second line `in vec3 vert;` says that this shader takes a single vertex as
input, into a variable named `vert`.

The third line defines a function called `main`, which is where the shader will
begin running. This is the same as in C, except in GLSL `main` does not take
any arguments and returns void.

The fourth line `gl_Position = vec4(vert, 1);` takes the input vertex and sends
it straight to the output without modifying it at all. The variable
`gl_Position` is a global defined by OpenGL, and is used to store the output of
the vertex shader. All vertex shaders must set the `gl_Position` variable. 

`gl_Position` is a 4D coordinate (vec4), but `vert` is a 3D coordinate (vec3),
so we convert `vert` into a 4D coordinate with `vec4(vert, 1)`. The second
argument, `1`, sets the value of the fourth dimension. We will learn more about
4D coordinates in later articles. For now, just know that if the fourth
dimension is `1`, then you can ignore the fourth dimension and treat it exactly
the same as a 3D coordinate. 

The vertex shader in this article doesn't actually do anything, but in later
articles we will be modifying it to handle animation, cameras, and other
things.


<h3><a name="fragment_shaders">Fragment Shaders</a></h3>

<blockquote class="pull-right">
  The main purpose of a fragment shader is to calculate the color of each pixel
  that is drawn.
</blockquote>

The main purpose of a fragment shader is to calculate the color of each pixel
that is drawn. 

A "fragment" is basically a pixel, so you can think of fragment shaders as
"pixel shaders." In this article each fragment is a pixel, but this isn't
always true. If you change certain OpenGL settings you can get fragments that
are smaller than pixels, but this is a topic for a later article.

Here is the GLSL code for the fragment shader used in this article:

```glsl
#version 150

out vec4 finalColor;

void main() {
    //set every drawn pixel to white
    finalColor = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
}
```

Once again, the first line `#version 150` tells OpenGL that this shader is
written in GLSL version 1.50.

The second line `out vec4 finalColor;` declares an output variable that will
hold the color of the pixel.

The fourth line `finalColor = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);` sets the output
variable to the color white. The part `vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)` creates an
RGBA color, with the red, green, blue and alpha set to maximum, which means the
color is white.

For now, everything that we draw in OpenGL will be pure white when we use this
shader. In later articles, we will add colors and textures. Textures are images
that you can put onto your 3D shapes.


<h3><a name="compiling_and_linking_shaders">Compiling And Linking Shaders</a></h3>

In C++, to make a program you first have to compile all the `.cpp` files, and
then link them together to make the final program. OpenGL shaders work in the
same way.

The code for this article contains two reusable classes that will handle the
compilation and linking of shaders: `tdogl::Shader` and `tdogl::Program`. There
isn't much code in these two classes, and the code is documented with comments,
so I suggest you read the code to understand how the OpenGL functions work.


<h2><a name="what_are_vbo_and_vao">What are VBOs and VAOs?</a></h2>

If shaders run on the GPU, and the rest of the C++ code runs on the CPU, you
need a way of sending data from the CPU to the GPU. In this article, we are
just sending the three points of a triangle, but in a larger project it would
be thousands of points of a 3D model, colors, texture coordinates, and other
things.

<blockquote class="pull-right">
  VBOs and VAOs are used to take data from your C++ program and send it through
  to the shaders for rendering.
</blockquote>

This is where we need Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) and Vertex Array Objects
(VAOs). VBOs and VAOs are used to take data from your C++ program and send it
through to the shaders for rendering.

In older versions of OpenGL, this data was sent to the GPU every frame using
functions like `glVertex`, `glTexCoord` and `glNormal`. In modern OpenGL, all
of this data must be sent to the graphics card using VBOs **before** it is
rendered. Then, when you actually want to render the data, you must set up VAOs
that describe how to pull the data out of the VBOs and feed it into the shader
variables.


<h3><a name="vertex_buffer_objects">Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs)</a></h3>

<blockquote class="pull-right">
  VBOs are "buffers" of video memory &ndash; just a bunch of bytes containing
  any kind of binary data you want.
</blockquote>

The first step to rendering our triangle is to upload (i.e. send) the three
points from normal memory to the video memory on the graphics card. This is
what VBOs are for. VBOs are "buffers" of video memory &ndash; just a bunch of
bytes containing any kind of binary data you want. You can upload 3D points,
colors, your music collection, poems to your loved ones &ndash; the VBO doesn't
care, because it just copies a chunk of memory without asking what the memory
contains.


<h3><a name="vertex_array_objects">Vertex Array Objects (VAOs)</a></h3>

The second step to rendering our triangle is to send the points from the VBO
into the shaders. Remember how the VBOs are just chunks of data, and have no
idea what *type* of data they contain? Somehow you have to tell OpenGL what
type of data is in the buffer, and this is what VAOs are for. 

<blockquote class="pull-right">
  VAOs are the link between the VBOs and the shader variables. VAOs describe
  what <em>type</em> of data is contained within a VBO, and which <em>shader
  variables</em> the data should be sent to.
</blockquote>

VAOs are the link between the VBOs and the shader variables. VAOs describe what
*type* of data is contained within a VBO, and which *shader variables* the data
should be sent to. Out of all the bad names in OpenGL, I think "Vertex Array
Object" is one of the worst, because it doesn't explain anything about what
VAOs actually do.

If you look at the vertex shader we are using (shown earlier in the article),
you will see that we only have one input variable called `vert`. In this
article, we will use a VAO to say *"hey OpenGL, this VBO right here has 3D
points in it, and I want you to send those points to the 'vert' variable in the
vertex shader."* 

In later articles, we will use VAOs to say *"hey OpenGL, this VBO right here
has 3D points, some colors, and some texture coordinates all mixed together in
a certain pattern. I want you to send the points to the 'vert' variable, the
colors to the 'vertColor' variable, and the texture coordinates to the
'vertTexCoord' variable in the shader."*

**A note for people with previous experience in OpenGL:**

If you have used VBOs *without* VAOs in older versions of OpenGL, then you
might not agree with this description of VAOs. You could argue that "vertex
attributes" set by `glVertexAttribPointer` are the link between the VBO and
that shaders, not VAOs. It depends on whether you consider the vertex
attributes to be "inside" the VAO (which I do), or whether they are global
state that is external to the VAO. Using the 3.2 core profile and my ATI
drivers, the VAO is not optional - `glEnableVertexAttribArray`,
`glVertexAttribPointer` and `glDrawArrays` all cause a `GL_INVALID_OPERATION`
error if there is no VAO bound. This is what leads me to believe that the
vertex attributes are inside the VAO, and not global state. The [3.2 core
profile spec][] says that VAOs are required, but I hear that only ATI drivers
throw errors if no VAO is bound. Here are some quotes from the [OpenGL 3.2 core
profile specification][]:

> All state related to the deﬁnition of data used by the vertex processor is
> encapsulated in a vertex array object.

> The currently bound vertex array object is used for all commands which modify
> vertex array state, such as VertexAttribPointer and EnableVertexAttribArray;
> all commands which draw from vertex arrays, such as DrawArrays and
> DrawElements; and all queries of vertex array state (see chapter 6).

However, I can see why vertex attributes could be considered to be external to
VAOs. `glVertexAttribPointer` predates VAOs, so there was a time when vertex
attributes were just global state. You could see VAOs as just a way to
efficiently change that global state. I prefer to think of it like this: if you
don't create a VAO, then OpenGL provides a default global VAO. So when you use
`glVertexAttribPointer` you are still modifying the vertex attributes inside a
VAO, it's just that you're modifying the default VAO instead of one you created
yourself.

There is a bit more of a discussion here:
http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/174577-Questions-on-VAOs


<h2><a name="explaining_the_code">Explaining The Code</a></h2>

Finally! The theory lesson is over and we can start digging into the code.
OpenGL is not very beginner-friendly, but if you understand the concepts that
have been explained so far in this article (shaders, VBOs, and VAOs) then you
are doing well.

Open the file `main.cpp` (`main.mm` on OSX), and we will walk through the code
starting at the `main()` function.

First, we initialise GLFW:

```cpp
glfwSetErrorCallback(OnError);
if(!glfwInit())
    throw std::runtime_error("glfwInit failed");
```

The `glfwSetErrorCallback(OnError)` line tells GLFW to call the `OnError`
function whenever an error occurs. The `OnError` function throws an exception
that contains the error message, so we can see what went wrong.

Next, we use GLFW to create a window:

```cpp
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT, GL_TRUE);
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE);
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 3);
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 2);
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_RESIZABLE, GL_FALSE);
gWindow = glfwCreateWindow((int)SCREEN_SIZE.x, (int)SCREEN_SIZE.y, "OpenGL Tutorial", NULL, NULL);
if(!gWindow)
    throw std::runtime_error("glfwCreateWindow failed. Can your hardware handle OpenGL 3.2?");
```

The window contains a forward-compatible OpenGL 3.2 core profile context. If
`glfwCreateWindow` is failing for you, then you may need to lower the OpenGL
version.

As the last step of window creation, we have to set the "current" OpenGL
context to the one in the window we just created:

```cpp
glfwMakeContextCurrent(gWindow);
```

Whenever we call an OpenGL function, that function affects the "current
context." We will only be using a single context, so we set this once and
forget about it. Theoretically, however, we could have multiple windows, and
each window would have its own context.

Now that we have an OpenGL context available in our window, we initialise GLEW
so that we get access to the OpenGL API functions.

```cpp
glewExperimental = GL_TRUE; //stops glew crashing on OSX :-/
if(glewInit() != GLEW_OK)
    throw std::runtime_error("glewInit failed");
```

As of writing this, GLEW has a few issues with the OpenGL core profile we are
using. Setting `glewExperimental` to true fixes the problem, but hopefully this
won't be necessary in the future.

We will also use GLEW to double-check that the 3.2 API is available:

```cpp
if(!GLEW_VERSION_3_2)
    throw std::runtime_error("OpenGL 3.2 API is not available.");
```

Inside the `LoadShaders` function, we compile and link a vertex shader and a
fragment shader using the `tdogl::Shader` and `tdogl::Program` classes provided
with this article.

```cpp
std::vector<tdogl::Shader> shaders;
shaders.push_back(tdogl::Shader::shaderFromFile(ResourcePath("vertex-shader.txt"), GL_VERTEX_SHADER));
shaders.push_back(tdogl::Shader::shaderFromFile(ResourcePath("fragment-shader.txt"), GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER));
gProgram = new tdogl::Program(shaders);
```

Inside the `LoadTriangle` function, we are going to make one VBO and one VAO.
The first step is to create and bind the a new VAO:

```cpp
glGenVertexArrays(1, &gVAO);
glBindVertexArray(gVAO);
```

Then we create and bind a new VBO:

```cpp
glGenBuffers(1, &gVBO);
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, gVBO);
```

Next, we upload some data into the new VBO. The data is going to be three
points, where each point is three `GLfloat`s.

```cpp
GLfloat vertexData[] = {
    //  X     Y     Z
     0.0f, 0.8f, 0.0f,
    -0.8f,-0.8f, 0.0f,
     0.8f,-0.8f, 0.0f,
};
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertexData), vertexData, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
```

Now that the buffer contains the three points of our triangle, it is time to
set up the VAO. First, we are going to enable the `vert` variable in the shader
program. Variables can be enabled and disabled, and they are disabled by
default, so we need to turn it on. The `vert` variable is an "attribute
variable," which is why the OpenGL functions have the word "Attrib" in their
name. We will see a different type of variable in future articles.

```cpp
glEnableVertexAttribArray(gProgram->attrib("vert"));
```

The most complicated part of VAO setup is this next function:
`glVertexAttribPointer`. Let's see the function call first, then I will explain
each argument.

```cpp
glVertexAttribPointer(gProgram->attrib("vert"), 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, NULL);
```

The first argument, `gProgram->attrib("vert")`, is the shader variable that the
data should be sent to. In this case, we want to send the data to the `vert`
variable of our shader.

The second argument, `3`, says that each vertex has three numbers.

The third argument, `GL_FLOAT`, says that the three numbers are `GLfloat`s.
This is important because if they were `GLdouble`s then the size of the data
would be different.

The fourth argument, `GL_FALSE`, says that we do not want the floats to be
"normalized." If they were normalized, they would be restricted to having a
minimum of zero, and a maximum of one. We don't want that restriction on our
points, which is why this argument is false.

The fifth argument, `0`, would be used if there was a gap in between each
point. Setting this argument to zero means that there are no gaps in our data.

The sixth argument, `NULL`, would be used if our data was not at the start of
the buffer. Setting this argument to NULL means that our data starts right at
the first byte of the VBO.

Now that the VBO and VAO are fully set up, we unbind them so they don't
accidentally get used somewhere else:

```cpp
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0);
glBindVertexArray(0);
```

At this point, the shaders, VBO, and VAO are ready for use. All we have to do
now is draw them inside the `Render` function.

First we clear the screen so that it is completely black:

```cpp
glClearColor(0, 0, 0, 1); // black
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
```

Next we tell OpenGL that we want to start using our shaders and our VAO:

```cpp
glUseProgram(gProgram->object());
glBindVertexArray(gVAO);
```

At last, we can draw that ever-elusive triangle:

```cpp
glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
```

This call to `glDrawArrays` says that we want to draw triangles, starting at
vertex zero, and ending after three vertices have been sent to the shader. It
will look at the currently bound VAO to determine where to get the vertices
from.

The vertices will be pulled out of the VBO and sent to the vertex shader. Then
each pixel within the triangle will be sent to the fragment shader. Then, the
fragment shader will make each pixel white. Hooray!

The drawing is finished now, so we unbind the shaders and the VAO just to be
safe:

```cpp
glBindVertexArray(0);
glUseProgram(0);
```

The last thing that needs to be done before we can see the triangle is to swap
the frame buffers:

```cpp
glfwSwapBuffers(gWindow);
```

Before the frame buffers were swapped, we were drawing to an off-screen frame
buffer that was not visible in the window we created at the start. When we call
`glfwSwapBuffers` the off-screen buffer becomes an on-screen buffer, so that we
can see it in the window.


<h2><a name="future_articles">Future Article Sneak Peek</a></h2>

In the next article we will texture the triangle with an image. In the article
after that we will learn a bit about matrix transformation, and use it in the
vertex shader to make a cube spin in 3D.

After that, we will start creating a 3D scene with a camera and multiple
objects.
